# CodeDojo-Secfail

Python solution by David HÃ©not and Manuel Dalle

* bruteForce.py cracks the first page by bruteforcing the pin code. Requires the [request python module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install)
* decrypt.py solves the first decryption puzzle (the key decryption explained in the decrypted text was done with pen and paper)
* decrypt2.py solves the last decryption puzzle
